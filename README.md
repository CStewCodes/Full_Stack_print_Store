# Full_Stack_print_Store

This is my first attempt at a full-stack web application




The end result is for this to be a web store to sell photography prints on different mediums, like a t-shirt or a mug (think of Walgreens photo online but I'm selling my own photos).
 
# Backend
I'm using Docker and Postgres to store my database and created my own express server using PG, dotenv, and PG.

# FrontEnd
